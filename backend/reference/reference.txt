This is a longer audio sample intended for voice cloning using the XTTS model. 
I will read this text clearly and at a natural pace. The goal is to capture 
the nuances of my voice, including intonation, pitch variations, and speaking 
rhythm over a continuous duration. Recording a slightly longer sample like 
this can sometimes provide the model with more comprehensive data to create 
a more accurate and natural-sounding cloned voice. I should ensure there is 
minimal background noise during this recording for the best results. Hopefully, 
this thirty-second sample will be sufficient for the cloning process.

This is a new reference audio recording for voice cloning. 
I will speak clearly and steadily for about fifteen seconds.
 Hopefully, this captures the essential qualities of my
  voice for the XTTS model to learn from. 
 The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
